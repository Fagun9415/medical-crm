						<p class="mb-0"><b>Our plan</b> is to bring together your local pharmacy, your favorite doctor and preferred laboratory under one umbrella to make you healthy and happy.We are not a large retailer or a famous hospital, nor we are a start-up set to revolutionize the healthcare and teach how people remain healthy.</p><p class="mb-0"><b>We see</b> rapid change taking over traditional Indian healthcare setup and unless something is done, where our friendly pharmacies, family doctor and next door laboratory are facing increasing competition from large corporate entities such as online pharmacy or telemedicine consultations that may threaten their independent existence in future.Bigger corporate entity always comes with abundance of online retail support while our local healthcare professional seldom learns how to use create website and support their own digital needs. They are always best what they are doing and that is treat patients, perform lab test or dispense medicines.</p>
						<p class="mb-0"><b>Even the patient is confused</b> with the competitive pricing and free services offered by online corporate entities. We strongly feel almost everyone want to continue with their decades old family doctor or their neighborhood pharmacy whose owner always handed the kids a free candy on every visit or the laboratory whose owner is a simply family man trying to get his kids educated to the best school in town.</p>
